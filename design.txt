## Resources 
- Health
- Mana - altering fabric of reality costs mana, resource that is spent to attack/alter the environment/drain stability/remove corruption, etc
- Stability - drained over time by existing in this dimension, restored by draining from other stable creatures

## Corruption
Spreads over time, alters reality in dangerous ways. The strength of the alterations are determined by the local density of corruption.
I.e the fraction of corrupted tiles over total tiles in an area.

## Spells
- sense entities within some radius, uses mana over time while on
- teleport to random location, uses mana and requires uninterrupted concentration for a while
- make a permanent change to the characteristics of the player, could also limit this by requiring a one-time-use alter or something

Each spell could be generated through alchemy, combinations of different reagents using different catalysts can produce different effects
Each reagent could have some meta-property that describes what effect it has, like heat, cleansing, light, etc
this could make the effect of some combinations somewhat predictable but could also have surprising/unexpected results

## Ai design ideas

- goblins/orc/troll - Hostile, spawn in a cave with a bunch of allies, kills stability sources to regain stability
    if you see a non-ally:
        attack
    elif you need stability:
        wander from room to room looking for stability sources to kill
    else:
        travel to home cave

- deer - Neutral, spawn in random room, stability naturally regenerates over time, will spend mana to remove corruption 
    if you see a hostile creature:
        run away
    elif you need mana:
        travel to nearest mana source and refill
    else:
        wander from room to room
